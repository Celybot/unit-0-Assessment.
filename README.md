The purpose of git is to give an opportunity to create a workspace for a repository that is made. People individually or in a group are able to take a repository and modify it, whatever way they want. Git allows us to be able to send and edit projects and give us the option to collaborate and work with each other.  When you git commit something you tell the computer what you want done to a series of files you edited.

The purpose of GitHub is to allow us to use git in an easier and more organized fashion. GitHub recognizes the different gits that exist and makes it so that we can collaborate and work together with the same function and website. That way, each member can be on the same page more easily. 

Git add command allows the git to know that you have changes that you made to your file and you would like them to be included when you're doing your next commit. Git add will read everything within your file and then copy it so that wherever you send out your copy, it should have the updated version of what you wrote. 

Git push allows you to fetch the last updated repository. Git push will look for the updated repository from the changed file and will give you that version. It basically pushes itself into the files that you connected together. 

Git clone allows you to download the repository to post onto an iud website.Once you git clone,the files you have from one website to the other should show. When we connect between GitHub and AWS it is because we cloned the link from github to add onto and edit into our AWS and vice versa. 

Forking is a way to allow access to someone to be able to view and change the repositories you come up with. The person gets a personal link that gives them the permission to join you as you use your git commands to communicate what you want to change within your repositories. 

When we create a branch, we are taking a specific file and we’re breaking it down into different versions Of the same file. We’re able to change things without jeopardizing what we originally wrote. Branching and forking both allows us to add, take out or change the original into our own. Branching gives us the option to work within our own files whereas forking requires an environment of people that’s able to change things around while deciding whether or not we want to keep the first file. Branching can sometimes cause issues within github because when we merge the branches, we are making updates to the original file including parts that share the same line, whereas when we do a fork we are changing a copy of the original file and making it our own versions to send to others.
